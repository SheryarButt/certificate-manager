# Certificate-Manager

Certificate-Manager is a Kubernetes controller that manages the lifecycle of certificates. It is built using Kubebuilder and the Operator SDK.

## Description

Certificate-Manager is a Kubernetes controller that watches for 'Certificate' custom resource, and creates a self-signed certificate based on the information provided in the custom resource spec. The controller then creates a secret with the certificate and key according to the name provided in the custom resource spec.

The controller has the following features:

- Create a self-signed certificate
- Create a secret with the certificate and key
- Update the certificate and key in the secret when the certificate is updated
- Delete the secret when the certificate is deleted (Optional)
- Reload the deployments using the certificate when the certificate is updated (Optional)
- Rotate the certificate when the certificate is expired (Optional)

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) or [K3D](https://k3d.io) to create a local cluster for testing, or you can use a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Setting up K3D Cluster (Optional)

1. Install K3D:

```sh
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash
```

1. Create a K3D cluster:

```sh
k3d cluster create TNC --agents=3 --port=443:443@loadbalancer
```

`TNC` is short for Three Node Cluster. You can name your cluster whatever you want.
`--agents=3` specifies the number of agents/nodes in the cluster.
`--port=443:443@loadbalancer` maps the host port 443 to the cluster port 443. This way you can access the cluster using `https://localhost`.

### Running on the cluster

1. Create a namespace for the controller:

```sh
kubectl create namespace certificate-manager
```

1. Install the helm chart:

```sh
helm install certificate-manager ./charts/certificate-manager --namespace certificate-manager
```

1. Create a Certificate custom resource:

```sh
kubectl apply -f examples/certificate.yaml
```

1. Check the secret created by the controller:

```sh
kubectl get secret  my-certificate-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d
```

### Uninstall the helm chart

```sh
helm uninstall certificate-manager --namespace certificate-manager
```

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

The controller watches for changes to the `Certificate` custom resource and takes the following actions:

1. When a `Certificate` resource is created, the controller creates a self-signed certificate and stores it in a secret.
1. When a `Certificate` resource is updated, the controller updates the certificate in the secret.
1. When a `Certificate` resource is deleted, the controller deletes the secret if the optional `PurgeOnDelete` field is set to `true`. Otherwise, the secret is left intact.
1. When a `Certificate` resource is updated, the controller reloads the deployments using the certificate if the optional `ReloadOnChange` field is set to `true`.
1. When a `Certificate` resource is expired, the controller rotates the certificate if the optional `RotateOnExpiry` field is set to `true`.

### Custom Resource Definition

The `Certificate` custom resource definition is defined in the `api/v1` directory.

```yaml
apiVersion: certs.k8c.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-certificate
  namespace: default
spec:
  # the DNS name for which the certificate should be issued
  dnsName: example.k8c.io
  # the time until the certificate expires
  validity: 360d
  # a reference to the Secret object in which the certificate is stored
  secretRef:
    name: my-certificate-secret
  # optional: purgeOnDelete will delete the secret when the certificate CR is deleted
  purgeOnDelete: false
  # optional: reloadOnChange will reload the deployments using the secret when the certificate is updated
  reloadOnChange: false
  # optional: rotateOnExpiry will rotate the certificate before it expires
  rotateOnExpiry: false
```
